        Heya! Welcome on this page. I'm just messing with some ideas right now,
        while writing down my thought process. Enjoy!

      <h2>Micromouse</h2>
      <p>
        A few days ago I found something about a
        <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36087330">Micromouse</a>
        competition which I found really interesting. <br /><br />
        This is when I started thinking about building something that emulates
        these mouses. Let's see how this pans out.
