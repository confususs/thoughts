        <h1>Ard's Experiments</h1>
        <p>
          Heya! Welcome to this page. I'm currently exploring various ideas and
          documenting my thought process. Enjoy!

        <h2>Micromouse</h2>
        <p>
          A few days ago, I came across the
          <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36087330">Micromouse</a>
          competition, which sparked my interest. <br /><br />
          This got me thinking about building something that emulates these
          robotic mice. Let's see how it turns out.
        </p>

        <h2>Mazes</h2>
        <p>
          First, we need mazes. I would like to be able to generate them and use
          a seed to reproduce a previously generated maze.<br /><br />

          Let's start by creating a web component that can generate an "empty
          maze".
        </p>
        <c-maze-1></c-maze-1>
        <p>
          Awesome! Now we need to use an algorithm to actually create the maze.
          There are many of them, but I particularly like the
          <a
            href="http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/1/24/maze-generation-hunt-and-kill-algorithm"
            >hunt and kill algorithm</a
          >, not only because it sounds cool, but also because it allows us to
          tweak the random walk algorithm it uses. I like this because in the
          Micromouse competitions, there are certain patterns in mazes that the
          maze designers like to use.<br /><br />

          However before we begin, let's first learn how seeds work..
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Seeds</h2>
        <p>
          Let's imagine a point in the middle of a square. We can open up the
          square through 4 directions: left, right, up and down. This square can
          be anywhere in the maze. If a maze has 4x4 squares, the second square
          in the second row has the identifier '6'. There are 4 choices, so the
          possible combinations are 6-left, 6-right, 6-up or 6-down.<br /><br />

          Now we need to go from a seed to one of these combinations. Below a
          simple table to test part of this functionality.
        </p>
        <c-seeded-choice-table-2></c-seeded-choice-table-2>
        <p>
          Cool! So we got some degree of reproducable "randomness" using a seed.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Testing a maze-building algorithm</h2>
        <p>
          I'd like to be able to step through whatever the algorithm is doing,
          so we can properly implement it. So first, we build something visual
          that we can use to test an algorithm. Let's adapt the previous maze to
          be able to differentiate between cells that the algorithm has visited
          and cells that the algorithm hasn't visited. We'll just use our random
          function to color roughly half of the cells grey-ish.
        </p>
        <c-maze-2 data-algorithm="random" data-seed="BQNO"></c-maze-2>
        <p>
          There are clear patterns emerging, which is kind of beautiful really.
          However one of the things I'm doing to seed the random function is
          extending the seed with some variables. In this case, the x and y
          coordinates and the row and column number of the cell. There are
          probably better ways to generate a seed in combination with these
          variables.
        </p>
        <c-maze-3 data-algorithm="random" data-seed="BQNO"></c-maze-3>
        <p>Much better already! Good enough for now.</p>

        <p>
          First, we'll start with an empty maze, this times with all walls
          closed and a simple mechanism that opens a random closed wall every
          second.
